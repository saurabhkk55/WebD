        <h1><span class="h1-span">Introduction:</span></h1>
        Many developers spend at least some of their time creating servers to distribute content on the internet. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) serves much of this content, whether it’s a request for a cat image or a request to load the tutorial you’re reading now. The Go standard library provides built-in support for creating an HTTP server to serve your web content or making HTTP requests to those servers.
        In this tutorial, you will create an HTTP server using Go’s standard library and then expand your server to read data from the request’s query string, the body, and form data. You’ll also update your program to respond to the request with your own HTTP headers and status codes.
        
        <h1><span class="h1-span">Prerequisites</span></h1>
        To follow this tutorial, you will need:
        <ul>
            <li>Go version 1.16 or greater installed. To set this up, follow the How To Install Go tutorial for your operating system.</li>
            <li>Ability to use curl to make web requests. To read up on curl, check out How To Download Files with cURL.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with using JSON in Go, which can be found in the How To Use JSON in Go tutorial.</li>
            <li>Experience with Go’s context package, which can be attained in the tutorial, How To Use Contexts in Go.</li>
            <li>Experience running goroutines and reading channels, which can be gained from the tutorial, How To Run Multiple Functions - Concurrently in Go.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with how HTTP requests are composed and sent (recommended).</li>
        </ul>

        <h1><span class="h1-span">Setting Up the Project</span></h1>        
        In Go, most of the HTTP functionality is provided by the <span class="h1-span">net/http</span> package in the standard library, while the rest of the network communication is provided by the net package. The net/http package not only includes the ability to make HTTP requests, but also provides an HTTP server you can use to handle those requests.
